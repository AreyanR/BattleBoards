BoardBattles

Game Overview:

In BoardBattles, the objective is to eliminate the opponent's king through strategic gameplay and successful piece captures. Players take turns moving their pieces on the board, and when one piece captures an opponent's piece, a combat sequence begins.

Each chess piece has its own health and attack power. The player who initiates the capture attack goes first in the combat phase. Players can choose from their piece's available attacks, taking turns attacking each other's pieces.

The battle continues until one piece's health drops to zero or below. The victorious piece claims the square, and the defeated piece is removed from the board. It's worth noting that pieces do not recover health after battles.

To win the game, you must strategically plan your moves, make successful piece captures, and ultimately eliminate the opponent's king. Your opponent will be trying to do the same, so be prepared for a challenging and exciting match of chess!"
